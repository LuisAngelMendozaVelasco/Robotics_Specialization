# Bayesian Estimation - Target Tracking

We will learn about the Gaussian distribution for tracking a dynamical system. We will start by discussing the dynamical systems and their impact on probability distributions. This linear Kalman filter system will be described in detail, and, in addition, non-linear filtering systems will be explored.
