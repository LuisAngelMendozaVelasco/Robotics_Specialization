# Projective Transformations

Now that we have a good camera model, we will explore the geometry of perspective projections in depth. We will find that this projection is the cause of the main challenge in perception, as we lose a dimension that we can no longer directly observe. In this module, we will learn about several properties of projective transformations in depth, such as vanishing points, which allow us to infer complex information beyond our basic camera model.
